My name is Landon Conover. I have been doing web development for about 15 years, give or take. I am excited to share with you some interesting things that I have found to be helpful when developing for the web.

I love all things data. I currently work on the Business Intelligence team at Utah Valley University as a Systems Administrator. I manage various tools and processes related to front end data development. Most of the processes are automated via web technologies.

I also teach for Utah Valley University. I teach Web Tools and Frameworks II, Web Languages II, and Intro to Scripting for the Web. Basically, I teach Javascript. I find it is a ton of fun to help students become better at web development and progress in their skills.
